It seems you're interested in resources related to psychosis, delirium, and health care advice during crises. Here's how I can help:

### 1. **Psychosis and Delirium Resources on GitHub**
There are repositories on GitHub that focus on delirium and psychosis, often using machine learning and electronic health records to predict or analyze these conditions. For example:
- [Delirium Predictive Models](https://github.com/ryanlu41/delirium/blob/master/README.md): This repository contains code for creating delirium predictive models using clinical data.
- [Delirium Analysis](https://github.com/aceyiyuan/delirium/blob/master/README.md): Another repository that explores the use of machine learning to predict delirium in ICU patients.

These repositories might provide insights into how technology is being used to address mental health challenges.

### 2. **Healthy Advice for Health Crises**
If you're looking for advice on managing health during a crisis or layoff, here are some general tips:
- **Mental Health Support**: Seek therapy or counseling to manage stress and emotional well-being. Online platforms like BetterHelp offer accessible options.
- **Physical Health**: Maintain a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep to support overall health.
- **Community Resources**: Look for local or online support groups to connect with others facing similar challenges.
- **Financial Planning**: If a layoff is involved, consider consulting a financial advisor to manage expenses and plan for the future.
